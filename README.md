# Osumon
Farm Pokemon while playing osu!

This "game" allows you to bind two keys(/clicks) (w and x by default) and everytime you tap one of those, an encounter against a Pokémon is launched, that Pokémon can be shiny (1/8192) and "Shadow" (the thing in Pokemon Colosseum) (1/1000000)
When you encounter a Pokémon that you cant to keep for any reason, you can catch it and later see it in your list of caught Pokémon

# How to play

You "just" have to press the two keys you binded in the options to launch an encounter you can play it as a game (#Hino) but you can also have it running with osu! and bind the same keys in osu! and in Osumon and then, when you will click a circle, an encounter will be launched

When you launch the game, a summary of the controls will show up

Ctrl+Alt+O is used to launch the "options" (where you bind your keys)
