# Osumon
Farm Pokemon while playing osu!

This "game" allows you to bind two keys(/clicks) (w and x by default) and everytime you tap one of those, an encounter against a Pokémon is launched, that Pokémon can be shiny (1/8192) and "Shadow" (the thing in Pokemon Colosseum) (1/1000000)
When you encounter a Pokémon that you want to keep for any reason, you can catch it and later see it in your list of caught Pokémon

# How to play

You "just" have to tap one of the two keys you binded in the options to launch an encounter.
You can play it as a game (bad idea but why not) but you can also have it running with osu! (not ran in administrator mode) and bind the same keys in osu! and in Osumon and then, when you will click a circle, an encounter will be launched

# Commands

Ctrl+Alt+O is used to launch the "options" (where you bind your keys)
you HAVE to use the corresponding number and not the letter/name of the key https://github.com/Haxel59/Osumon/blob/master/Keys.txt

When using Alt+A while a line is selected in the "Encounter" window, the selected Pokémon will be caught and added to the list you can see with Alt+P

Alt+P opens/closes a window with the Pokémon you caught using Alt+A

Ctrl+Q exit the game and save your encounters in a .txt in the same folder as the game (You can edit it manually if you want to but tbh I don't care)
